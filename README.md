# Linear-Regression-Model-and-Ridge-Regularization-to-Improve-the-Model---Using-House-Prices-Dataset

House Prices Dataset, Data Preparation and Machine Learning Models
Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting

The dataset can be download on kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data and the description of the files in the Data set highlighted below

Data Description File
train.csv - the training set
test.csv - the test set
data_description.txt - full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the - - column names used here
sample_submission.csv - a benchmark submission from a linear regression on year and month of sale, lot square footage, and number of bedrooms.
The description of the columns and features in the dataset, can be found in the dataset zip folder named "data_description.txt". You can also convert the data description into excel format to make it more ease to view

In order to make sales prices prediction from the dataset, the following steps will be taken into consideration:

Acquire the data
Explore the data
Engineer and transform the features and the target variable
Build a model
Make predictions
